# Landing Topline Clients — Reference

Extended material, full workflows, and `.cursorrules` snippet. Topline clients hire **proof you can solve their specific problem**; Cursor helps you build that proof faster than mockups alone.

---

## Rapid Speculative Projects

**What:** Build functional prototypes for companies you want to work with — before they hire you.

**Workflow**

```
1. Research target company's product gaps or brand weaknesses.
2. In Cursor: "Build a landing page for [Company X] repositioned for [audience Y].
   Use their existing brand colors but modernize the typography and layout."
3. Generate working HTML/CSS/JS (~30 min), deploy to Vercel.
4. Send to their head of design: "I made this. Thoughts?"
```

**Why it works:** You skip the "can I see your portfolio" conversation. You show them what you'd actually do.

**Prompts**

- "Create a landing page for a luxury AI hardware company. Minimal, editorial, dark mode."
- "Build a product demo video script + storyboard for a developer tool targeting creative agencies."
- "Generate a brand guidelines PDF structure for a Series A fintech."

## Case Study Generation

**What:** Turn raw project notes into polished case studies fast.

**Workflow**

```
1. Dump project notes, screenshots, outcomes into a markdown file.
2. "Turn this into a case study with sections: Challenge, Insight, Approach, Outcome.
   Write for a creative director audience, not engineers. Make it narrative, not bullet points."
3. Iterate: "Make it sound like it belongs in It's Nice That, not a SaaS blog."
4. Export to portfolio.
```

**Prompts**

- "Rewrite this case study for a fashion brand audience. Less metrics, more vision."
- "Add a 'Cultural Context' section explaining why this project matters beyond the client."
- "Generate 3 pull quotes from this case study I could use on social."

## Outreach Personalization at Scale

**What:** Write custom pitches for many prospects without it feeling templated.

**Workflow**

```
1. Create a base pitch template.
2. For each prospect, feed Cursor their website, recent work, and news.
3. "Personalize this pitch for [Company]. Reference their recent [campaign/launch/hire].
   Keep it under 100 words. Sound like a peer, not a vendor."
4. Review, tweak, send.
```

**Prompts**

- "Write a cold email to the CD at [Agency] about their rebrand. Compliment specifically, then pivot to how I could help with their digital presence."
- "Draft a LinkedIn message to [Founder] that references their recent funding round and positions me as a fractional design lead."
- "Write 3 variations of this outreach — one confident, one curious, one provocative."

---

## Proposal Generation

**What:** Turn a discovery call into a scoped proposal in hours, not days.

**Workflow**

```
1. Paste your call notes.
2. "Generate a proposal with: Executive Summary, Scope, Phases, Timeline, Investment.
   Position this as strategic partnership, not hourly work.
   Use value-based framing — what they gain, not what I do."
3. Add your pricing using the allocation model.
4. Export to PDF via markdown.
```

**Prompts**

- "Write an executive summary that makes this feel like a $50k engagement, not a $10k one."
- "Add a 'Why Now' section that creates urgency without being salesy."
- "Generate 3 tier options: Essential, Standard, Premium — with clear value differentiation."

## Portfolio Site Iteration

**What:** Continuously test and improve your portfolio based on who you're targeting.

**Workflow**

```
1. Clone your portfolio repo.
2. Create audience-specific versions:
   /tech    — product-focused, metrics-heavy
   /culture — editorial, visual-forward, narrative
   /luxury  — minimal, restrained, prestige signaling
3. Use Cursor to rapidly adjust copy, layout, and project order.
4. Deploy each to a subdomain.
5. Send the right version to the right prospect.
```

**Prompts**

- "Rewrite my portfolio intro for a luxury fashion audience. Remove all tech jargon."
- "Reorder these projects for a media company — lead with the most visually striking."
- "Generate a new About page that positions me as a creative director, not a product designer."

---

## Content Creation Pipeline

**What:** Build thought leadership that attracts inbound.

**Workflow**

```
1. Voice-memo your ideas during the day.
2. Transcribe (Whisper API or native).
3. "Turn this ramble into a Twitter thread. Sharp, opinionated, no fluff.
   End with something people want to quote."
4. Generate 3 variations, pick the best.
5. Schedule via Buffer/Typefully.
```

**Weekly target:** 2 Twitter threads · 1 LinkedIn post · 1 case study update

**Prompts**

- "Turn this observation about AI design into a spicy tweet thread. Be specific, not vague."
- "Write a LinkedIn post about this project that doesn't sound like LinkedIn."
- "Generate 5 tweet ideas from this case study — each should stand alone."

---

## Competitive Intelligence

**What:** Understand how topline clients talk so you can speak their language.

**Workflow**

```
1. Scrape a prospect's job postings, press releases, investor updates.
2. "Analyze the language this company uses. What do they value? What words repeat? What's their tone?"
3. Use those patterns in your outreach and proposals.
```

**Prompts**

- "What does this company's careers page reveal about their design culture?"
- "Compare how [Company A] and [Company B] talk about design. What's the difference?"
- "Rewrite my pitch using the vocabulary from this company's website."

## .cursorrules Snippet

Add to project root (e.g. `.cursorrules` or project rules):

```markdown
# Artifice Voice Rules

## Tone
- Direct, not clever
- Confident, not arrogant
- Specific, not vague
- Peer-to-peer, not vendor-to-client

## Writing
- Short sentences. Punch, then breathe.
- No jargon unless the audience uses it
- No "I believe" or "I think" — just state it
- End on action or insight, not summary

## Portfolio
- Lead with the visual, explain after
- Frame projects as worlds, not deliverables
- Show taste through references, not claims

## Outreach
- First line: specific to them
- Second line: what you noticed
- Third line: what you'd do
- No more than 100 words

## Proposals
- Value-based, not time-based
- Three tiers when possible
- "Investment" not "Cost"
- Always include "Why Now"
```

## The Edge

Most designers wait for inbound. Use Cursor to:

1. Build proof before you're hired  
2. Personalize at scale without sounding templated  
3. Ship content that attracts the right clients  
4. Generate proposals that close faster  

The designers charging $50k+ for brand engagements aren’t 10× better — they’re 10× faster at demonstrating value. Cursor is how you close that gap.
