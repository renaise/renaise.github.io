# Landing Topline Clients with Cursor

Use Cursor to demonstrate value before you're hired. Topline clients hire **proof you can solve their specific problem**, not portfolios alone.

## Core Strategy

1. **Build proof before you're hired** — functional prototypes for target companies  
2. **Personalize at scale** — custom pitches without sounding templated  
3. **Ship content that attracts** — thought leadership that generates inbound  
4. **Generate proposals that close** — value-based scoping in hours, not days  

---

## 1. Rapid Speculative Projects

Build functional prototypes for companies you want to work with.

**Workflow**

1. Research target company's product gaps or brand weaknesses.
2. Prompt: *"Build a landing page for [Company X] repositioned for [audience Y]. Use their existing brand colors but modernize the typography and layout."*
3. Generate working HTML/CSS/JS, deploy to Vercel.
4. Send to their head of design: *"I made this. Thoughts?"*

**Example prompts**

- *"Create a landing page for a luxury AI hardware company. Minimal, editorial, dark mode."*
- *"Build a product demo video script + storyboard for a developer tool targeting creative agencies."*
- *"Generate a brand guidelines PDF structure for a Series A fintech."*

## 2. Case Study Generation

Turn raw project notes into polished case studies fast.

**Workflow**

1. Dump project notes, screenshots, outcomes into markdown.
2. Prompt: *"Turn this into a case study with sections: Challenge, Insight, Approach, Outcome. Write for a creative director audience, not engineers. Make it narrative, not bullet points."*
3. Iterate on tone: *"Make it sound like it belongs in It's Nice That, not a SaaS blog."*
4. Export to portfolio.

**Example prompts**

- *"Rewrite this case study for a fashion brand audience. Less metrics, more vision."*
- *"Add a 'Cultural Context' section explaining why this project matters beyond the client."*
- *"Generate 3 pull quotes from this case study I could use on social."*

## 3. Outreach Personalization at Scale

Write custom pitches for multiple prospects without feeling templated.

**Workflow**

1. Create base pitch template.
2. For each prospect, feed their website, recent work, and news.
3. Prompt: *"Personalize this pitch for [Company]. Reference their recent [campaign/launch/hire]. Keep it under 100 words. Sound like a peer, not a vendor."*
4. Review, tweak, send.

**Example prompts**

- *"Write a cold email to the CD at [Agency] about their rebrand. Compliment specifically, then pivot to how I could help with their digital presence."*
- *"Draft a LinkedIn message to [Founder] that references their recent funding round and positions me as a fractional design lead."*
- *"Write 3 variations of this outreach — one confident, one curious, one provocative."*

---

## 4. Proposal Generation

Turn discovery call notes into scoped proposals in hours, not days.

**Workflow**

1. Paste call notes.
2. Prompt: *"Generate a proposal with: Executive Summary, Scope, Phases, Timeline, Investment. Position this as strategic partnership, not hourly work. Use value-based framing — what they gain, not what I do."*
3. Add pricing using allocation model, export to PDF via markdown.

**Example prompts**

- *"Write an executive summary that makes this feel like a $50k engagement, not a $10k one."*
- *"Add a 'Why Now' section that creates urgency without being salesy."*
- *"Generate 3 tier options: Essential, Standard, Premium — with clear value differentiation."*

---

## 5. Portfolio Site Iteration

Continuously test and improve portfolio based on target audience.

**Workflow**

1. Clone portfolio repo.
2. Create audience-specific versions:  
   `/tech` — product-focused, metrics-heavy ·  
   `/culture` — editorial, visual-forward, narrative ·  
   `/luxury` — minimal, restrained, prestige signaling  
3. Use Cursor to adjust copy, layout, project order.
4. Deploy each to subdomain; send the right version to the right prospect.

**Example prompts**

- *"Rewrite my portfolio intro for a luxury fashion audience. Remove all tech jargon."*
- *"Reorder these projects for a media company — lead with the most visually striking."*
- *"Generate a new About page that positions me as a creative director, not a product designer."*

---

## 6. Content Creation Pipeline

Build thought leadership that attracts inbound.

**Workflow**

1. Voice-memo ideas during the day; transcribe (Whisper API or native).
2. Prompt: *"Turn this ramble into a Twitter thread. Sharp, opinionated, no fluff. End with something people want to quote."*
3. Generate 3 variations, pick the best; schedule via Buffer/Typefully.

**Weekly target:** 2 Twitter threads · 1 LinkedIn post · 1 case study update

**Example prompts**

- *"Turn this observation about AI design into a spicy tweet thread. Be specific, not vague."*
- *"Write a LinkedIn post about this project that doesn't sound like LinkedIn."*
- *"Generate 5 tweet ideas from this case study — each should stand alone."*

---

## 7. Competitive Intelligence

Understand how topline clients talk so you can speak their language.

**Workflow**

1. Scrape prospect's job postings, press releases, investor updates.
2. Prompt: *"Analyze the language this company uses. What do they value? What words repeat? What's their tone?"*
3. Use those patterns in outreach and proposals.

**Example prompts**

- *"What does this company's careers page reveal about their design culture?"*
- *"Compare how [Company A] and [Company B] talk about design. What's the difference?"*
- *"Rewrite my pitch using the vocabulary from this company's website."*

## Voice & Tone

Apply when generating any client-facing content.

| Area | Guidelines |
|------|------------|
| **Tone** | Direct, not clever · Confident, not arrogant · Specific, not vague · Peer-to-peer, not vendor-to-client |
| **Writing** | Short sentences. Punch, then breathe. No jargon unless the audience uses it. No "I believe" / "I think" — just state it. End on action or insight, not summary. |
| **Portfolio** | Lead with the visual, explain after. Frame projects as worlds, not deliverables. Show taste through references, not claims. |
| **Outreach** | Line 1: specific to them · Line 2: what you noticed · Line 3: what you'd do. No more than 100 words. |
| **Proposals** | Value-based, not time-based. Three tiers when possible. "Investment" not "Cost." Always include "Why Now." |
